## Content
I found reverse engineering games and building game "hacks" interesting so I started researching and this is a brainchild of thatðŸ§ 

If you find it interesting as well, this is a nice book to help you - ``Practical Reverse Engineering (Wiley, 2014)``

## Features

* **Aimbot** - Lock onto body features while shooting.
* **ESP** - Enemy body outline seen through walls. Color changes depending on enemy health.
* **NoRecoil** - Limit the amount of recoil applied while shooting.

**Note** - I haven't had issues with VAC, so as far as I know it's undetected. There is an issue with the new updates made to CS:GO so you'll have to launch with the `-untrusted` flag in order to use it. Don't ask me what this shvt means Google exists.

## Thanks
